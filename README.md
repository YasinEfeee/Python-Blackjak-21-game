# Python-Blackjak-21-game
This project is a simple Blackjack game for beginners written in Pyhton. Thanks for your interest :)

I'm still developing my code, and as noted, an Ace is only equal to 11. Please reach out if you encounter any bugs and help me improve the code and myself.

Have Fun :)

## What is the Blackjack?
Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is a popular card game played in casinos worldwide.
The objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it.
Each player is dealt two cards initially, and they can choose to 'hit' (receive another card) or 'stand' (keep their current hand).

#### Card Values:
Jack, Queen, King: Each is worth 10 points. 

2 to 10: Represent the face value of the cards. 

Ace: It can have a value of 1 or 11.

#### !Note: In Blackjack, the Ace can typically have a value of 1 or 11. However, in this code, the Ace is assigned a fixed value of 11. Therefore, be mindful that having two Aces could result in a total of 22, exceeding the limit of 21.
